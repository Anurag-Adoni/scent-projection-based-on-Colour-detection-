<p><h2>Abstract:</h2>
Research says that people deficient in one sense such as vision or hearing often acquire
heightened acuity in another. And some studies support this notion by showing that areas of the
brain known to control vision can respond to other forms of sensory stimuli in persons without
sight. We often associate colors with other sensory stimuli. Synesthesia is defined as "the
production of a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of
another sense or part of the body." This is a complicated way of saying that people with
synesthesia have blended senses. The most common type of synesthesia is called graphene, in
which numbers and letters are intuitively linked with color this device links our sense of color with
our sense of smell this can be used in a myriad of applications from teaching visually impaired
people to form new neural connections to recognize different smells to visualize a particular color
or to recognize an environment. It also has applications in the media to create a method to smell
particular scenes in a video</p>

<p><h2>Objectives:</h2>
This paper proposes an olfactory device that can generate a localized odour distribution based
on dominant color recognition using computer vision allowing viewers to experience scents while
watching their videos and a method for visually impaired to recognize colors. We have developed
this device that is low cost and can be built on off the shelf components and can be built with low
technical skills and yet provides high-quality olfactory capabilities
The proposed device can give a sensation that a particular odor based upon the color recognized
with the sensor or by image processing of a video frame. On the device, small CPU Fans are
placed in front of pre-defined scent pods, the airflows generated by the fans are deflected multiple
times by colliding with the scent pods which is then directed towards the user by introducing odor
vapour into the airflows.</p>
